We have three options of datasets that we use in our project. Either one of can be used to see the usage of the code.

1. Github - The datasets from Github are already labelled and can be used on the fly using our source_code

2. We customized our own datasets from the following: THis datasets is about 1.1 million as we combined all the below datasets.
   We used a another source code to pre-process and generate this our new datasets with contains benign and malicious labels

	Phishtank: This contains a datasets of phising URL. THese are raw datasets that needs to be cleaned.
